# PAXEXAM Apache Karaf extension Changelog

## v1.0.0

The 1.0.0 release does not differ in many ways from the previous 0.5.0 release except for some minor improvements and new features. But since there had not been many new features in the mean time we've decided to signal the stability of the extension by pushing the version number to 1.0.0.

* [#8] Add changelog.md file to source tree

With the switch to the Github Issue tracker we needed a new way to add a changelog. This had been changed by adding this file.
