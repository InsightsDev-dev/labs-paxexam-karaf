# PAXEXAM Apache Karaf extension Changelog

## v1.0.0

The 1.0.0 release does not differ in many ways from the previous 0.5.0 release except for some minor improvements and new features. But since there had not been many new features in the mean time we've decided to signal the stability of the extension by pushing the version number to 1.0.0.

### Features

* [#10] Add new option to set start lvl of bundles deployed in setup features.xml

With the deafault start lvls inthe initial features.xml it could happen from time to time that the exam bundle is not started correctly. In case those start lvls are set lower (or make completely configurable) it was possible to work around this problem.

* [#6] Add new option to change used invoker

In pax-exam the invoker is chosen by the pax.exam.invoker system property. By now the PaxExam Karaf extension uses only junit by default. With this extension you can now add "KarafDistributionOption.useOwnKarafExamSystemConfiguration("myCustomInvokerConfig")" to your options, overwriting the default junit configuration.

### Improvements

* [#8] Add changelog.md file to source tree

With the switch to the Github Issue tracker we needed a new way to add a changelog. This had been changed by adding this file.
